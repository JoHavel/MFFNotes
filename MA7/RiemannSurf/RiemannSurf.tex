\section{Introduction}
\begin{poznamka}[Literature]
	„Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves“, Renzo Cavalieri and Eric Miles
\end{poznamka}

\subsection{Differentiability}
\begin{definice}[Differentiable]
	A function $f: ®C \rightarrow ®C$ is differentiable (also holomorphic) at a point $z_0 \in ®C$ if the following limit exists
	$$ \lim_{|h| \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h} =: f'(z_0) \in ®C. $$

	We call $f'(z_0)$ the derivative of $f$ at $z_0$. A function $f$ is differentiable on a domain (open connected subset of ®C) if its differentiable for all points of this domain.
\end{definice}

\begin{poznamka}[Writing complex numbers in cartesian cooridnates]
	$z = x + iy$, for $x, y \in ®R$, we can write a function $f: ®C \rightarrow ®C$ in terms of two functions $u, v: ®R^2 \rightarrow ®R$ such that
	$$ f(x, y) = u(x, y) + i·v(x, y). $$
\end{poznamka}

\begin{veta}[Cauchy–Riemann equations]
	Let $f: ®C \rightarrow ®C$ be a holomorphic function on an open subset of ®C. Considering $f = u + iv$, then
	$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \qquad \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}. $$
\end{veta}

\begin{definice}[Orientability, orientation-preserving function]
	Define and equivalence relation on the set of all bases of $®R^2$ by saying that $B_1 \sim B_2$ iff the determinant of the change of basis matrix is positive.

	A function $f: ®R^2 \supset U \rightarrow ®R^2$ is said to be orientation-preserving if on an open dense subset of $U$, the determinant of the Jacobi matrix is positive. Jacobi matrix:
	$$ J(f) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix}. $$
\end{definice}

\begin{dusledek}
	Let $f$ be a non-constant holomorphic function, then $f$ is orientation-preserving.

	\begin{dusledek}
		Since $f$ is holomorphic, the Cauchy-Riemann equations implies that
		$$ \det(J(f)) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial v}{y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \overset{\text{C–R}}= \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\)^2 + \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\)^2 ≥ 0. $$
		Since $f$ is non-constant, the inequality is strict on a dense open subset of the domain of definition.
	\end{dusledek}
\end{dusledek}

\begin{veta}[Open mapping theorem]
	A non-constant holomorphic function $f$ is open (that is if $U$ is an open subset of ®C, then $f(U)$ is also open).
\end{veta}

\subsection{Integration}
\begin{definice}
	For a path $γ$ (smooth function, $γ: ®R \supset [a, b] \rightarrow ®C$) we define
	$$ \int_γ f(x) dx := \int_a^b f(γ(t))·γ'(t) dt $$
\end{definice}

% 10. 10. 2023

\begin{definice}[Continuous deformation]
	For $γ, μ: [a, b] \rightarrow U$ ($U$ simply connected), paths with the same endpoints ($γ(a) = μ(a)$ and $γ(b) = μ(b)$). Then a continuous deformation $γ$ into $μ$ is a continuous function $H: [a, b] \times [0, 1] \rightarrow U \subseteq ®C$ such that $H(s, 0) = γ(s)$, $H(s, 1) = μ(s)$, $H(a, t) = z_a := γ(a) = μ(a)$ and $H(b, t) = z_b := γ(b) = μ(b)$.
\end{definice}

\begin{veta}
	Suppose that $γ, μ: [a, b] \rightarrow U$ ($U$ simply connected) are related by a continuous deformation of paths $H$. Then for any holomorphic function $f$ on $U$ we have
	$$ \int_γ f(z)dz = \int_μ f(z) dz. $$

	\begin{dukazin}[Partial proof assuming $H$ admits partial derivatives]
		For any $t \in [0, 1]$ we integrate the function $INT(t) = \int_{H(·, t)} f(z) dz$. Consider the derivative of $INT(t)$ with respect to $t$:
		$$ \frac{d}{dt} (INT(t)) = \frac{d}{dt} \(\int_a^b f(H(s, t)) \frac{\partial H}{\partial s}(s, t) ds\) \overset{\text{Leibniz + chain rule}}=  $$
		$$ = \int_a^b f'(H(s, t)) \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}(s, t)·\frac{\partial H}{\partial s}(s, t) + f(H(s, t)) \frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial s \partial t}(s, t) ds = $$
		$$ = \int_a^b \frac{d}{ds}\[f(H(s, t)) \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}\]ds = $$
		$$ = f(H(s, t)) \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} |_{s=a}^{s = b} \overset{\text{constant endpoints}}= 0. $$

		Having derivative identically equal to 0, means that $INT(t)$ is a constant function and $\int_γ f(z)dz = INT(0) = INT(1) = \int_μ f(z) dz$.
	\end{dukazin}
\end{veta}

\begin{dusledek}
	Let $U$ be a simply connected subset of ®C and $f: U \rightarrow ®C$ a holomorphic function. For any closed path whose image is inside $U$, $\int_γ f(z) dz = 0$.

	\begin{dukazin}[Sketch]
		The definition of simply connected is (essentially) the same as saying that any closed path can be continuously deformed to a constant path $c$.
		$$ \int_γ f(z) dz = \int_c f(z) dz = \int_a^b f(c(z))·c'(z) dz = \int_a^b f(c(z)) · 0 dz = 0 $$
	\end{dukazin}
\end{dusledek}

\begin{priklad}
	Let $U$ be a simple connected domain and $f: U \rightarrow ®C$ a holomorphic function on $U \setminus \{z_0\}$. For $j = 1, 2$, let $γ_j$ be a path parametrizing a circle centered at $z_0$ of radius $r_j$, oriented counterclockwise and completely contained in $U$. Show that $\oint_{γ_1} f(z) dz = \oint_{γ_2} f(z) dz$.
\end{priklad}

\subsection{Cauchy's integral formula}
\begin{veta}[Cauchy's integral formula]
	Let $γ$ be a loop around $z \in ®C$, and $f: U \rightarrow ®C$ a holomorphic function. For $U$ a neighbourhood of $γ$,
	$$ f(z) = \frac{1}{2πi} \oint_γ \frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw. $$

	\begin{dukazin}
		Conway 1978, Chapter IV.
	\end{dukazin}
\end{veta}

\begin{dusledek}
	$$ f(z) = \frac{1}{2πi} \oint_γ \frac{f(w)}{w - z_0 + z_0 - z} dw = \frac{1}{2πi} \oint \frac{f(w)}{w - z_0}·\(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{z - z_0}{w - z_0}}\)dw = $$
	$$ = \frac{1}{2πi} \oint_γ \frac{f(w)}{w - z_0} \(\sum_{n=0}^∞ \frac{(z - z_0)^n}{(w - z_0)^n}\) dw = $$
	$$ = \sum_{n=0}^∞ \(\frac{1}{2πi} \oint_γ \frac{f(w)}{(w - z_0)^n}\) (z - z_0)^n. $$
	For sufficiently "small" (shrunken) $γ$. So $f$ is smooth (infinitely differentiable). Moreover, it is analytic (that is, its Taylor expansion around $z_0$ converges to $f$ in a neighbourhood of $z_0$).
\end{dusledek}

\begin{definice}[Pole]
	Given a positive integer $n$, a complex function $f$ has pole of order $n$ at the point $z_0 \in ®C$ if $(z - z_0)^n f(z)$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ but $(z - z_0)^{n - 1} f(z)$ is not.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}
	Show that if $f$ has a pole of order $n$ at $z_0 \in ®C$. Then it admits a Laurient expansion $f(z) = \sum_{k = -n}^∞ a_k (z - z_0)^k$ with $a_{-n} ≠ 0$.
\end{priklad}

\begin{definice}[Residue]
	Let $f$ have a pole of order $n$ at the point $z_0 \in ®C$. Then the residue of $f$ at $z_0$ is the $k=-1$ coefficient of the Laurent expansion of $f$ at $z_0$.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}
	Show that if $f$ has a pole of order $1$ at $z_0$, then the residue of $f$ at $z_0$ can be computed as the following limit:
	$$ \res_{z=z_0} f(z) = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} (z - z_0)f(z). $$
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}[Residue theorem]
	Let $γ: [a, b] \rightarrow U \subset ®C$ be a simple closed path, bounding a domain $W$ containing the points $z_1, …, z_m$. Assume that $f$ is holomorphic on $U \setminus \{z_1, …, z_m\}$ and has poles at $\{z, …, z_m\}$. Show that
	$$ \oint_γ f(z) dz = 2πi \sum_{j=1}^m \res_{z = z_j} f(z). $$
\end{priklad}

\subsection{(Real) Projective space}
\begin{poznamka}[Building structures]
	Set $\rightarrow$ Topology $\rightarrow$ Differential structure (atlas) $\rightarrow$ Riemann metric $\rightarrow$ Connection…
\end{poznamka}

\begin{definice}[Real projective space]
	The set $®P^n(®R)$ is defined to be either of the following bijective sets: Lines through the origin in $®R^{n+1}$; Equivalence classes of $(n+1)$-tuples of real numbers $(x_0, …, x_n) ≠ (0, …, 0)$, such that for any real number $λ \in ®R^* = ®R \setminus \{0\}$: $(x_0, …, x_n) \sim (λ x_0, …, λ x_n)$.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}
	Confirm that the sets above are in bijection with each other.
\end{priklad}

\begin{poznamka}[Notation]
	We will often denote a point in $®P^n(®R)$ as the equivalence class $[x_0, …, x_n]$.
\end{poznamka}

\begin{definice}[Topology of $®P^n(®R)$]
	We give a topology to $®P^n(®R)$ by endowing it with following quotient topology: consider the surjection $π: ®R^{n+1} \setminus \{¦o\} \rightarrow ®P^n(®R)$, $(x_0, …, x_n) \mapsto [x_0, …, x_n]$. A set $U \subset ®P^n(®R)$ is defined to be open if $π^{-1}(U) := \{x \in ®R^{n+1} \setminus \{¦o\} \middle| π(x) \in U\}$ is open in $®R^{n+1} \setminus \{¦o\}$.

	That is we give $®P^n(®R)$ the finest topology that makes $π$ continuous.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}
	Check that for ®C we can define $®P^n(®C)$ or $®C ®P^n$ the same way.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}[Projective space]
	$®R^* = ®R \setminus \{0\}$ is an abelian group. Let $®R^*$ act on $®R^{n+1}$ by component wise multiplication. When a general group $G$ acts on a set $X$ we have equivalence relation $x \sim y$ if $y = g ∘ x$. We call the equivalence classes the orbits of $G$. So $®P^n(®R) = \(®R^{n+1} \setminus \{¦o\}\) / ®R^*$.

	Sphere quotient: Let $S^n \subseteq ®R^{n+1}$. Denote the unit sphere. Then the group $®Z_2 = \{+1, -1\}$ act on the sphere by $±1(x_0, …, x_n) = (±x_0, …, ±x_n)$. Then $S^n / ®Z_2 = ®P^n(®R)$.

	Disk model: Consider the $n$-dimensional closed unit disk $\overline{®D^n} \subseteq ®R^n$, and the equivalence relation on the points of the boundary: $x \sim -x$ if $\|x\| = 1$. Then $®P^n(®R)$ is the quotient (collection of equivalence classes), i.e. $\overline{D^n} \setminus \sim \simeq ®P^n(®R)$.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}
	Conclude from either of these models of $®P^n(®R)$ that as a topological space, $®R^n(®P)$ is compact and Hausdorff.
\end{priklad}

\begin{poznamka}
	Now we come to the smooth manifold structures. Let's start with $®P^1(®R)$. Define
	$$ U_x := ®P^1(®R) \setminus \{[x, y] \in ®P^1(®R) | x = 0\}, \qquad φ_x: U_x \rightarrow ®R, \quad φ_x([x, y]) = \frac{x}{y}. $$
	Similarly, we define a second chart:
	$$ U_y := ®P^1(®R) \setminus \{[x, y] \in ®P^1(®R) | y = 0\}, \qquad φ_y: U_y \rightarrow ®R, \quad φ_y([x, y]) = \frac{y}{x}. $$

	\begin{prikladin}
		Check that $U_x, U_y$ are open and that $φ_x, φ_y$ are homeomorphisms.
	\end{prikladin}

	\begin{dukazin}
		Consider the translation functions:
		$$ U = U_x \cap U_y = \{[x, y] \in ®P^1(®R) | x, y ≠ 0\}, \qquad φ_x(U) = φ_y(U) = ®R \setminus \{0\}. $$
		The translation function $T_{x, y} := φ_y ∘ (φ_x)^{-1}$ sends, for $y ≠ 0$:
		$$ T_{x, y}: y \overset{(φ_x)^{-1}}\mapsto [1, y] = \[\frac{1}{y}, 1\] \overset{φ_y}\mapsto \frac{1}{y}. $$
		Which is smooth on the domain $®R \setminus \{0\}$.

		TODO smooth. Thus $®P^1(®R)$ is a smooth manifold.
	\end{dukazin}
\end{poznamka}

\begin{priklad}
	Show that $®P^1(®R)$ is homomorphic to the circle $S^1$. We call $®P^1(®R)$ the real projective line.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}
	Try to show that $®C®P^1 = ®P^1(®C)$ is a smooth manifold.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}
	For $®P^2(®R)$ the followings charts form atlas:
	$$ U_x := \{[x, y, z] | x ≠ 0\}, \qquad φ_x: U_x \rightarrow ®R, \quad φ_x([x, y, z]) = \(\frac{y}{x}, \frac{z}{x}\), $$
	$$ U_y := \{[x, y, z] | y ≠ 0\}, \qquad φ_y: U_y \rightarrow ®R, \quad φ_y([x, y, z]) = \(\frac{x}{y}, \frac{z}{y}\), $$
	$$ U_z := \{[x, y, z] | z ≠ 0\}, \qquad φ_z: U_z \rightarrow ®R, \quad φ_z([x, y, z]) = \(\frac{x}{z}, \frac{y}{z}\). $$
	Check these are open subsets and homeomorphisms, with smooth transformation functions. And extend this to $®P^n(®R)$.
\end{priklad}

\subsection{Compact surfaces}
\begin{definice}[Surface]
	A surface is a manifold of real dimension 2.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklady}
	$®R^2$, ®C, and any of their open subsets are surfaces. $S^2$ is a compact surface, as is $®P^2(®R)$.
\end{priklady}

\begin{definice}[Connected surface]
	Given two connected surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$, the connected surface $S_1 \# S_2$ is the surface obtained by removing an open disc from each of the surfaces and identifying the resulting boundaries via a homeomorphism.
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}
	At the level of topological spaces, show that the operation $\#$ is well defined up to homeomorphism, that is, show that the choice of disks in $S_1$ and $S_2$ does not change the definition of $S_1 \# S_2$ / homeomorphism.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}
	Show that $\#$ gives the set of homeomorphism classes of connected compact surfaces the structure of a monoid. (Which surface is the identity of the monoid?)
\end{priklad}

\begin{veta}[Classification of compact surfaces]
	Any connected, compact surfaces is homeomorphic to exactly one surface in the following list:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $S^2$;
		\item $T^{\# g} := T \# … \# T$, $g \in ®N_0$;
		\item $®P^2(®R)^{\#n} := ®P^2(®R) \# … \# ®P^2(®R)$, $n \in ®N_0$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{veta}

\begin{poznamka}[Deep fact]
	For $d ≤ 3$, if two $d$-dimensional manifolds are homeomorphic, then they are diffeomorphic.
\end{poznamka}

\section{Riemann surfaces}
\begin{definice}[Riemann surface]
	A Riemann surface is a complex analytic manifold of dimension 1:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $X$ is a Hausdorff, connected topological space;
		\item for all $x \in X$, there is a homeomorphism $φ_x: U_x \rightarrow V_x$, where $U_x$ is an open neighbourhood of $x \in X$, $V_x$ is an open set in ®C;
		\item for any $U_x$, $U_y$ such that $U_x \cap U_y ≠ \O$, the transition function $T_{x, y} := φ_y ∘ φ_x^{-1}: φ_x(U_x \cap U_y) \rightarrow φ_y(U_x \cap U_y)$ is holomorphic.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{poznamkain}
		We saw in the first lecture that a holomorphic preserves orientation when thought of as a function from the real plane to itself. Since our transition functions are holomorphic, any Riemann surface is orientable.
	\end{poznamkain}
\end{definice}

\begin{priklad}[The complex projective line]
	Just as for $®P^1(®R)$, we define $®P^1(®C)$ to be the set whose elements are complex $1$-dimensional subspaces of $®C^2$.

	Let $U_1 = U_2 := ®C$ and define $g: U_1 \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow U_2 \setminus \{0\}$, $z \mapsto \frac{1}{z}$. We define $®P^1(®C)$ to be the quotient $®P^1(®C) := U_1 \coprod U_2 / (z \sim g(z))$.
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}[Show that]
	As a set $®P^1(®C)$ is ®C plus a point.

	As a topological space $®P^1(®C)$ is the one point compactification of ®C.

	Conclude from the previous sentence that $®P^1(®C)$ is homeomorphic to the two sphere.
\end{priklad}

\begin{poznamka}
	In complex analysis $®P^1(®C)$ is known as the Riemann sphere.
\end{poznamka}

\begin{poznamka}
	For $i = 1, 2$, we denote the image of $U_i$ in the quotient $U_1 \coprod U_2 / (z \sim g(z))$ by $[U_i]$. Note that $U_i$ define the local coordinate functions: $φ_i: [U_i] \rightarrow U_i$, $p \mapsto z_i$, where $z_i$ is the complex numbers in $U_i$ such that $[z_i] = p_i$. Both $φ_1$, $φ_2$ are homeomorphisms.

	We now consider the transition functions: the intersection
	$$ [U_1] \cap [U_2] = [U_i \setminus \{0\}] = [U_2 \setminus \{0\}]. $$
	The image of the intersection under $φ_1$ is $φ_1([U_i] \cap [U_2]) = ®C \setminus \{0\}$ (*). Thus (*) is the domain of our single transition function $T = φ_2 ∘ φ_1^{-1}$. For $z_1 ≠ 0$, we have $T: z_1 \overset{φ_1^{-1}}\mapsto [z_1] = [z_2 := g(z_1) = 1 / z_1] \overset{φ_1}\mapsto z_2 = 1 / z_1$. Thus
	$$ T: ®C \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow ®C \qquad z \mapsto \frac{1}{z}. $$
	Since $T$ has a pole only at $z_1 = 0$, we see that it is holomorphic on $®C \setminus \{0\}$. A symmetric (exchange 1 for 2) calculation shows that $T^{-1}$ is also holomorphic. So $®P^1(®C)$ is a Riemann surface.
\end{poznamka}

\begin{priklad}[Hopf fibration]
	Consider the 3-dimensional real sphere $S^3 \subseteq ®C^2 = ®R^4$. Given a point $p \in S^3$, $\exists$ a unique line $l_p$ through the origin and $p$. Thus we got a function $H: S^3 \rightarrow ®P^1(®C)$, $p \mapsto l_p$.

	Check that $H$ is continuous and surjective. Since $S^3$ is closed and bounded, it is compact. Moreover, since the image of a compact set under a continuous function is compact, $®P^1(®C)$ is compact.

	What is the fiber of the surjective map $H: S^3 \rightarrow ®P^1(®C)$, i.e. what is $H^{-1}(p)$, for any point $p \in ®P^1(®C)$. (Hint: It is $S^1$.)

	This gives us $S^2 \times S^1 = S^3$ as set. (Not as topological space!)
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}[Complex tori]
	Definition: Let $τ_1$ and $τ_2$ be two complex numbers, that are linearly independent. The set of all integral linear combinations of $τ_1$ and $τ_2$:
	$$ Λ := \{nτ_1, mτ_2 | n,m \in ®Z\} \subseteq ®C $$
	is called the lattice of $τ_1$ and $τ_2$.

	Observe that we can assume that $τ_1 = 1$, and $\Im(τ_2) > 0$, allowing to make simplifying assumption: that our lattice has the form $Λ = \{n + mτ | n, m \in ®Z, τ \in ®H\}$, where $®H$ is the upper half plane.

	Consider the quotient space $T = ®C / Λ$. THat is the quotient space with respect to the equivalence relation $z_2 \sim z_1 \Leftrightarrow z_2 = z_1 + w$ for $w \in Λ$.

	The canonical projection map $π: ®C \rightarrow T$ (i.e. $π(z) = [z]$) induces a quotient topology on $T$ (i.e. $V \subseteq T$ is open iff $p^{-1}(V)$ is open in ®C).
\end{priklad}

\begin{priklad}
	For $P$ the closed parallelogram with vertices $0, 1, τ, 1+τ$, show that for any $z \in ®C\ \exists z' \in P$ that $π|_p \rightarrow T$ is surjective. Hence we can restrict our attention to $p$.
\end{priklad}
